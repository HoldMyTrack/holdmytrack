# Known Issues

Defects in already-shipped, currently-live functionality — not planned work. `docs/ROADMAP.md` is the forward-looking build plan ("what we're going to do"); this file is the opposite direction ("what's currently broken and needs fixing"), independent of any phase or priority ordering.

This file stays lean and current-only. Once an entry is fixed, its root-cause/fix/verification write-up moves into `docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md` as a permanent implementation note next to the relevant pipeline step, and the entry is deleted from here. Nothing here is meant to accumulate as a permanent record — that record lives in `IMPLEMENTATION.md` once each issue is closed.

### Trends leaves out empty weeks and months, so its bars don't show the 12 months `SPEC.md` FR-9 describes

FR-9 behavior 3 says the Profile page renders the trailing 12 months as one bar per bucket. `activityTrendsQuery` (`services/server/internal/httpapi/activities.go`) groups only the account's activities, so a week or month with none never comes back, and both clients draw one bar per period returned (`buildTrendBars`, `profile/TrendsChartView`). A history with two active weeks draws two bars filling the whole chart, each half its width, with nothing to show the other 50 weeks were empty; the axis's two dates are the first and last active period, not the window's ends. Found on the Android emulator against a local stack while porting the page; the web's `/profile` draws the same two bars.

- [ ] Fill the gaps — in the query (`generate_series` over the window's buckets, left-joined) or in each client — so every week or month of the window has a bar, at the 2px minimum when empty, and the axis shows the window's ends.
- [ ] Check the web page and the Android screen against an account with a few active weeks months apart.
